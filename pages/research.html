                <p>We compare two small open economics, Iceland and Ireland, that experienced a capital inflow through their
                    banking systems in the period preceding the 2008 financial crises but differ in their currency arrangements.
                    Both countries have mostly recovered from their respective crises, but the differences in the way their
                    economies adjusted are interesting. The evidence suggests that changes in the real exchange rate served
                    as the adjusting mechanism for Iceland's current account while in Ireland domestic demand compression
                    served as the main adjustment mechanism. We also explore the adjustment to the crisis in three other
                    Eurozone economies and find that they were similar to the one in Ireland.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>In the wake of Brexit, this paper aims to provide a measure for the quantile dependence amongst different
                    financial assets – bond, stock, and currency – within the UK market and their cross-border linkages with
                    the European equity market. We implement a nonparametric estimation method for both the tail and quantile
                    dependence parameters on weekly data over the period 1989–2016 using copula. Our results suggest that
                    the contagion effects between stock and currency markets are limited, even under extreme fluctuations.
                    We also find a weak comovement between currency and bond markets, however, evidence of asymmetry is found
                    in the dependence structure, possibly due to the ‘risk-reward’ scenario of international investors. Finally,
                    our results indicate a weak dependence between stock returns and bond yields, possibly due to the low-yielding
                    gilt and the thirst for income, pushing investors to diversify globally into other financial markets.

                (with Mikael Byrialsen), European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies: Intervention, 2018</li>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>This paper attempts to analyse the macroeconomic effects of unemployment benefits in a small open economy.
                    We adopt a stock–flow consistent (SFC) approach with an emphasis on the dynamics of the labour market.
                    We numerically solve the model using a combination of estimation and calibration to generate statistics
                    for our key variables, reflecting features of the Danish economy. We then analyse the effects of a fall
                    in the unemployment compensation rate on the economy. The results indicate that a fall in the compensation
                    rate at a macro level leads to a trade-off between a fall in aggregate demand and a rise in net exports.
                    Due to this trade-off, the net effect of a fall in the compensation rate on the aggregate unemployment
                    rate tends to be weak. Our analyses in this paper raise several questions on the existing views regarding
                    unemployment benefits adopted by a large strand of the economic literature.

                <p>Most studies assume symmetry between saving and investment changes. They are wrong to do so. We model the
                    response of investment to positive and negative changes in saving for 17 OECD countries from 1960 to
                    2015. We use both panel and time series methods. We find that negative changes in saving have a stronger
                    effect on investment than positive changes in saving do. In the short run, causality only runs from negative
                    changes in saving to investment. In the long run, both negative and positive changes in saving Granger
                    cause investment. Models relying on saving-investment symmetry in the long run are called into question.
                    Policies assuming symmetric effects throughout the business cycle are similarly flawed.

                <p>We explain the 2008 crisis in Iceland and Ireland with an emphasis on the role financialisation played in
                    destabilising these countries’ economies. The two small open economies share similarities in that both
                    countries had capital inflows before the crisis, ending with a sudden stop. However, the mechanisms of
                    the crisis, which induced the capital flows, the factors that influenced them and their effects on the
                    real economy differed due to differences in currency regimes and the response to the crises. We investigate
                    the link between financialisation and the transmission channels of financialisation on the macroeconomy,
                    using ARDL methodology. Finally, we suggest policy prescriptions to limit the scale and scope of similar
                    crises in the future while highlighting the institutional differences between the two economies.

                <p>We investigate the relationship between household debt and income inequality in the USA, allowing for asymmetry,

                    debt and inequality for different regimes. Our results indicate household debt only responds to positive
                    changes in income inequality, while there is no evidence of falling inequality significantly affecting
                    household debt. The presence of this asymmetry provides further empirical insights into the emerging

                <p>We explore the effects of capital mobility on the relationship between savings and investment using historical
                    data for Iceland. First, we analyse the saving-investment (S-I) correlation for the period of restricted
                    capital mobility using data from 1960 and 1994. We then add a period of free capital mobility between
                    1994 and 2008 and estimate the correlation for the period 1960-2008. Finally, we extend our analysis
                    to the 2008 to 2016 period, when capital controls were imposed in response to the crisis. Institutions
                    matter: We find institutional changes, in particular Iceland’s entry into the European Single Market
                    in 1994, coincided with a fall in the long-run correlation between savings and investment. However, the
                    correlation weakens further when the recent regime of capital controls is included, which implies that
                    savings and investment are not related during the recent period of crisis and capital controls. We discuss
                    the possible reasons for this pattern and also the implications of our findings for post-crisis policy

                    monetary policy using using data from 1995 to 2015 for a panel of 10 European countries. We employ a
                    panel VAR model, and estimate it using a GMM system. Our findings indicate that a contractionary monetary
                    policy shock immediately increases securitisation activities and decreases the growth rate of traditional
                    (non-securitised) loans. The evidence supports the argument that merely raising interest rate is not

                <p>This study contributes to the existing literature on financial development, crises, and recovery in small open economies. 
                    In this dissertation, we use Iceland as an example of a small open economy with a sovereign currency and compare it with 
                    Ireland and other periphery countries from the EMU. We critically examine the developments that preceded the crises in 
                    Iceland and Ireland with an emphasis on the role of capital inflows. We then empirically investigate the recovery pattern 
                    in Iceland and other peripheral countries. Our findings can be summarised as follows. The process of financial development 
                    and its interaction with the real sector in Iceland and Ireland greatly differ primarily due to their exchange rate regimes 
                    amongst other things. Comparing the two countries, we find that the adjustment following a sudden stop to a capital inflow 
                    was faster in Iceland but the collapse more serious. In particular, the current account adjustment was the result of 
                    real exchange rate depreciations and domestic demand compression. For Ireland and other members of the eurozone, 
                    the adjustment process is much slower. The adjustment in the current account has been the result of domestic demand compression
                    in these countries, which have resulted in long-lasting recessions, deflation and high unemployment in Ireland, as well as in
                    Italy, Portugal and Spain. Moreover, our findings suggest that the role of capital controls combined with 
                  financial restructuring was crucial in the post-crisis period in Iceland. Finally, we present a macroeconomic framework
                in order to understand the process of crisis and recovery in small open economies. We demonstrate the generation of
                financial crisis and the subsequent adjustment process in a sovereign currency regime through the use of simulations.
